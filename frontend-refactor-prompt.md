- ‚úÖ CommandPalette already implemented with cmdk
- ‚úÖ Added tooltips to ChatComposer (tools toggle, voice toggle, mic, send buttons)
- ‚úÖ Added tooltip to UploadDialog button
- ‚úÖ Created QuickStartGuide component with feature cards and links

### Priority Next Steps
1. **Backend Integration**: Connect settings page handlers to actual API endpoints (export/clear/delete)
2. **Mobile Experience**: Add swipe gestures with framer-motion
3. **Testing**: Add unit tests (Vitest) and E2E tests (Playwright)
4. **Accessibility**: Conduct comprehensive color contrast audit
5. **Performance**: Add optimistic updates with rollback for mutations

## Phase 1.3: Settings Page Enhancement (Needs Backend Integration)
- **Connect settings handlers to actual API endpoints**: The settings page UI is complete, but handlers for export/clear/delete need to be connected to real backend endpoints once they're available.
- **API key regeneration**: Implement actual API call for regenerate key (currently shows placeholder toast).
- **Data export/clear/delete**: Connect to backend endpoints for exporting sessions, clearing history, and deleting account.

## Phase 2: UX Improvements (Mostly Complete)

  - ‚úÖ Added sticky compose bar at bottom on mobile
  - ‚úÖ Auto-scroll to latest message already implemented with useAutoScroll
  - TODO: Implement swipe gestures with framer-motion:
    - Right swipe: Open session list
    - Left swipe: Open insights panel
    - Down swipe: Close keyboard
    - Pull down: Refresh
  - TODO: Add haptic feedback for button presses on mobile (if supported)
  - TODO: Add visual waveform for voice recording

## Phase 3: Polish & Quality (Mostly Complete)
- **3.1 Error Handling** (COMPLETE):
  - ‚úÖ ErrorBoundary integrated throughout app
  - ‚úÖ API client with comprehensive error types
  - ‚úÖ ConversationPane wrapped with ErrorBoundary in page.tsx
- **3.2 Loading States** (PARTIALLY COMPLETE):
  - ‚úÖ Loading skeletons in analytics, documents, lists
  - ‚úÖ Loading spinners present in upload/send buttons
  - ‚úÖ Streaming indicator badge shows during AI responses
  - TODO: Implement optimistic updates with rollback for mutations (create session, send message, upload document)
- **3.3 Code Quality & Accessibility** (MOSTLY COMPLETE):
  - ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode enabled
  - ‚úÖ Performance optimizations (lazy loading, React.memo)
  - ‚úÖ Added comprehensive ARIA labels to MessageList, buttons, and interactive elements
  - ‚úÖ Mobile touch targets meet 44x44px minimum requirement
  - TODO: Conduct full color contrast audit with WCAG AA standards
  - TODO: Add React.memo to more components if needed for performance

## Phase 4: Quick Wins (Complete)

- **4.5 Keyboard Shortcuts Hint**: ‚úÖ Floating hint component implemented

## Testing Requirements (Pending)
- **Unit Tests (Vitest)**:
  - Add tests for custom hooks (useChatController, useDocumentUpload, useKeyboardShortcut)
  - Add tests for API client functions
  - Add tests for utility functions (shortcuts helpers, format functions)
  - Aim for 70-90% code coverage
  - Test edge cases for auth, upload, analytics
- **E2E Tests (Playwright)**:

  - Document prop types for all major components
  - Add architecture documentation

## üìù Implementation Notes

### What's Working Well
- TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type safety
- Settings persistence with localStorage
- Error boundaries catching runtime errors
- Comprehensive error handling with specific error types
- Loading states with skeletons throughout
- Lazy loading for route-level code splitting
- Performance optimizations (React.memo on heavy components)
- Accessibility basics (skip links, ARIA labels, tooltips)
- Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts system
- Onboarding flow with localStorage tracking
- Contextual help with searchable FAQs and shortcuts
- Floating keyboard hints for discoverability

### Known Issues / Technical Debt
- Settings page handlers need backend API endpoints (export, clear, regenerate key)
- Mobile swipe gestures not yet implemented
- Visual waveform for voice recording not implemented
- No tests written yet (unit or E2E)
- Full color contrast audit needed (WCAG AA standards)
- Optimistic updates not yet implemented for mutations
- Documentation needs updating (README, CONTRIBUTING, API docs)
- Keyboard shortcuts configuration UI not yet added to settings

### Implementation Strategy Going Forward
1. **Short-term** (1-2 days):
   - Connect settings page to backend APIs when ready
   - Implement optimistic updates for key mutations
   - Add configuration UI for keyboard shortcuts in settings
   - Audit toast usage across all async operations
2. **Medium-term** (1 week):
   - Implement swipe gestures for mobile with framer-motion
   - Add visual waveform for voice recording
   - Conduct comprehensive color contrast audit (WCAG AA)
   - Add haptic feedback for mobile button presses
3. **Long-term** (ongoing):
   - Write comprehensive unit tests (aim for 70%+ coverage)
   - Add E2E tests for critical user flows
   - Update documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, API docs)
   - Monitor and optimize performance with React.memo where needed
