  - TODO: Add architecture documentation (data flow diagrams, component hierarchy)

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### What's Working Well
- TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type safety
- Settings persistence with localStorage
- Error boundaries catching runtime errors
- Comprehensive error handling with specific error types
- Loading states with skeletons throughout
- Lazy loading for route-level code splitting
- Performance optimizations (React.memo on heavy components)
- Accessibility basics (skip links, ARIA labels, tooltips)
- Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts system
- Onboarding flow with localStorage tracking
- Contextual help with searchable FAQs and shortcuts
- Floating keyboard hints for discoverability

### Known Issues / Technical Debt
- Automated test coverage still missing for complex flows (only basic hooks covered so far)
- Full color contrast audit needed (WCAG AA standards)
- Architecture documentation (data flow diagrams, component hierarchy) still outstanding
- Rename session mutation could benefit from optimistic updates (delete already has it)

### Implementation Strategy Going Forward
1. **Short-term** (1-2 days):
   - ✅ **DONE**: Add JSDoc comments to all hooks with usage examples
   - ✅ **DONE**: Complete JSDoc documentation for major components
   - ✅ **DONE**: Validated chat session creation flow (already has optimistic handling via temp session with id <= 0)
   - TODO: Capture and add updated UI screenshots to the README
2. **Medium-term** (1 week):
   - TODO: Conduct comprehensive color contrast audit (WCAG AA)
   - TODO: Add architecture documentation (data flow, component hierarchy)
   - TODO: Add optimistic updates to rename session mutation
3. **Long-term** (ongoing):
   - TODO: Write comprehensive unit tests (aim for 70%+ coverage)
   - TODO: Add E2E tests for critical user flows (documents, sessions, analytics, onboarding)
   - TODO: Monitor and optimize performance with React.memo where needed
